## 📈 PREDICTION LOGIC

### Event Classifications:

**Inverse Events** (Higher = Bad for USD = Good for Gold):
- Unemployment Rate
- Jobless Claims

**Direct Events** (Higher = Good for USD = Bad for Gold):
- Nonfarm Payrolls
- Average Hourly Earnings

### Weighted Prediction Formula:

```
Score = (Unemployment_Prediction × Weight_U) + 
        (NFP_Prediction × Weight_NFP) + 
        (Earnings_Prediction × Weight_E)

Direction = Score > 0 ? "UP" : "DOWN"
```

Where predictions are:
- UP = +1
- DOWN = -1

Weights vary by month according to month psychology profiles.

## 💡 WHY THIS WORKS

### Economic Cycle Alignment:
The weighted system recognizes that different economic indicators matter more during specific times of the year:

1. **Seasonal Hiring Patterns**: May NFP matters because it captures spring hiring momentum
2. **Corporate Cycles**: June earnings matter because of mid-year review cycles
3. **Year-End Dynamics**: Oct/Dec unemployment matters because of holiday employment clarity

### Market Psychology:
Traders and algorithms likely already weight these factors intuitively, so aligning with market psychology improves prediction accuracy.

### Fundamental Drivers:
The system identifies which fundamental driver has the most reliable forecast-to-actual relationship in each month.

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Backtest on additional years** to validate pattern consistency
2. **Incorporate actual vs forecast surprise** magnitude
3. **Add momentum indicators** from previous months
4. **Test intraday entry/exit timing** within the first candle
5. **Combine with technical analysis** for entry refinement

By understanding the economic calendar's seasonal rhythms and corporate cycles, we can make more informed predictions about which economic indicators will drive gold price movements.
